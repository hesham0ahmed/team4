    <p id="mentoringP">For a lot of our recently graduated course members it is really important to have someone like a mentor for their first steps into the tech-job-world.<br>Starting work in an often totally new working sector comes with a lot of fear and anxiety.<br>
    Is there something better then sharing your experience with other young people?<br>The mentoring program won't just bring you new working and tech ideas but maybe also a new friend.<br>Connect through your interest in coding!</p>
