    <p id="mentoringP">For a lot of our recently graduated course members it is important to have someone like <b>you</b>!<br><br> <b>Support</b> your mentee with his/her first steps into the tech-job-world.<br><br><b>Starting work</b> in a new job sector comes with a lot of fear and anxiety.<br><br>
    Is there something better then <b>sharing your experience</b> with other young people?<br><br>The mentoring program won't just bring you new working and coding ideas but maybe also a new friend.<br><br><b>Connect through your love to coding!</b></p>
